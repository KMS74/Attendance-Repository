#Attendance-Repository
This project provide teachers a way to store attendance of students of an academic organisation with ease. The front-end of the project is an interface for teachers which enables them to mark attendance of students for their every lecture hour for which JAVA Swings GUI toolkit will be used. In the back-end, the information given by user is stored in form of a table using database (here we are using MySQL). The user can retrieve any kind of information from the data stored and utilise it as per requirement which is accomplished by JDBC. Add ons such as:

List of students short of attendance (below 75%)
Average attendance percentage of student / class
Edit attendance of student / class and few more makes this project unique.
